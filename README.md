## Project Overview
   *  The goal of this project is to create a 3D game using raycasting. The project involves creating a window with SDL2, implementing raycasting to draw walls, and allowing for camera angle adjustments.
   *  You have a link :link: to a very good and very long tutorial about raycasting in the :point_right: [Tips and links.](https://github.com/Kingvadee/alx-maze_project./blob/master/README.md) [../](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/misc/2021/1/9da3b82dc0bcfea07858b70956de47f0e2db2dad.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20231114%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20231114T181815Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=ca81f04ee1d4fa253ae436e324d8060e0c4706fea99e41eaf45e6554e88db015) section in the [README.md](https://github.com/Kingvadee/alx-maze_project./blob/master/README.md) file.
   * Please have a lot of fun Exploring this project ! :smile::grin::grinning:
